# Typo-Assistant:
A Typing application to check your speed and accuracy in typing

# Approach:
> The project follows a structured and modular approach using Python and Tkinter. Initially, a graphical user interface (GUI) is designed using Tkinter frames to divide the application into different screens such as login, typing test, and results.

> A random typing passage is selected from a predefined list. The timer starts automatically when the user begins typing, ensuring accurate time measurement. The user’s input is then captured and processed to calculate typing speed and accuracy.

> Finally, the results are displayed on a separate screen, and the user is given an option to restart the test. This approach ensures clarity, reusability, and a user-friendly experience.

# Methodology (Step-by-Step Flow)

1. The application starts with a login screen where the user enters their name.
2. A random passage is selected from a predefined list of texts.
3. The typing test screen displays the selected passage.
4. The timer starts on the first key press by the user.
5. The user types the given passage and clicks the “I’m Done” button.
6. The program calculates time taken, words per minute (WPM), and accuracy.
7. The results are displayed on the result screen.
8. The user can restart the test for multiple attempts.
